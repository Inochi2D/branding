### Stance on Eroge/Erotic Games
While the Inochi2D Project in itself has nothing against Eroge/Erotic Games, we do reserve the right to not provide support to developers of games which we find to be in bad taste.  
(Eg. games depicting rape in a "positive" way, depicting underage (looking) characters in adult situations, etc.)

### Stance on Cryptocurrencies and NFTs
You are not under any circumstance allowed to use Inochi2D's branding assets to promote anything to do with blockchain, cryptocurrency or NFTs.  
We will not accept any donations in the form of cryptocurrency either.
